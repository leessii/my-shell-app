# My-Shell-APP

"This project, developed using Spring Shell, aims to help users find engaging activities when boredom strikes. 
The application features a web client that makes GET requests to the Bored API (https://www.boredapi.com/). 
Users can leverage the power of ShellOption to customize their activity search by specifying parameters such as '--type' according to their preferences.

The web client interface comes with robust features, 
including autocompletion and input validation, 
ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience. 
Notably, the application offers two distinct implementations for the web client:

### Spring Boot Web Client:

```A native implementation utilizing the Spring Boot Web Client for making requests.```

### OpenAPI-Generated WebClient:

```Leveraging the OpenAPI generator to automatically generate a web client, enhancing flexibility and reducing development effort.```

Enjoy the app!
